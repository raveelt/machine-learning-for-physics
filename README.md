This repository is created for my PHYS 310: Machine Learning for Physics and Astronomy class at the University of British Columbia.
The class follows Viviana Acquaviva's Machine Learning for Physics and Astronomy textbook.
In this repository you can find lab work in the form of Jupyter Notebooks that follow along with the contents of the textbook.

In the final month of class, every student picks a project surrounding the topics learned in class. I chose to pursue:

Neural Network Classification of Top Quark Production at the Large Hadron Collider

More details can be found in the formal Report.pdf in the Project folder.
